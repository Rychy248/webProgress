        meaning:
            "A raised-eyebrow emoji gives a questioning and skeptical look. It can be used to express skepticism, disbelief, or disapproval, and its expression is similar to the signature facial expressions of comedian Stephen Colbert and actor/wrestler Dwayne “The Rock“ Johnson. The neutral mouth and furrowed eyebrows allow for a variety of emotions such as concern, anger, suspicion, and disapproval. This emoji is great for situations where you want to question a statement or action, take a critical stance, or make someone think in a humorous way."

        emoji: "🧐",
        name: "Face With Monocle",
        meaning:
            "With its monocle, the 🧐 emoji represents a face that was considered a status symbol in the 19th century. It shows furrowed eyebrows and a slightly raised head, as if examining something closely. Used to indicate that something seems suspicious to you, or that you are making a skeptical or ironic observation. In this way, it encourages close examination and promotes critical thinking. At the same time, it can also convey a certain sophistication or smug intelligence, as if you're acting like a “smartass“. Great for casting a wary eye around, this emoji is a fancier version of the brooding smiley face."
